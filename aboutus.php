        Every time we hear SRISTI, our mind and heart roar out in unison – YOU ARE HERE TO IMAGINE, YOU ARE HERE TO CREATE! For all those daydreamers out there, with the remotest of ideas ranging from a new opening in chess to a new use of an Arduino, you must know that if you are passionate about it, these turn into an obsession.<br><br>

        At SRISTI, that obsessive imagination is what we want you to unleash – unleash it in front of us, in front of the all those who are as obsessive as you in their respective fields. Let us help you turn that lifelong dream into realistic applications beneficial to all of us and in the process, you shall inspire others. We turn daydreamers into thinkers and leaders but that requires your toil too. Yes, that’s the standard we set here at SRISTI.<br><br>

        Here at SRISTI, we promise to pamper your quirk, encourage and expand your conceptual perimeter and cheer you on every step you take off the tracks. We aim towards recreation for the betterment. You would find few platforms better than this grand annual techno-management gala of Jalpaiguri Government Engineering College which was first started in 2010, the largest of its kind in North Bengal.<br><br>

        JGEC has been at the forefront of technical expertise ever since its inception in 1961; SRISTI was conceived much later in, and it’s among the best of the feathers in our hat, helping us to further stamp our authority with aplomb. With its 9th  year approaching, we know better than how it has helped us climb the ladder of success one rung at a time and we welcome you all to be a part of it.<br><br>

        So, gear up for this mega event where you’ll have to compete with passionate and like-minded individuals. From propelling a rocket to debating your heart out in GMUN, from trying to be the Quizzard to modelling a bridge till dawn, we shall be with you all the time. And it’s a given that you will be cheered as much for a goal in Robo-Soccer or FIFA as for a headshot in Counter-Strike.<br><br>

        Let’s be clear, being ordinary is living a life without any imagination, without any risks. So, the rules of SRISTI is that there are no rules. Get a group of friends who resonate strongly with your thoughts and get going. Build, break, recreate and form lifelong bonds.<br><br>

        The 3 days might ignite a spark in the ever-curious brain of yours and you’ll enjoy the process. It’s our way of life! Make it yours too.<br><br>

        And as Donovan Livingston says – “The sky is not the limit, it’s just the beginning! Lift Off!”
